# Kirblue's NSMBW Stuff
This is collection of random stuff I've made over the years for NSMBW.

If you have trouble/issues setting up one of these things, feel free to open an issue (or a pull request if you want to fix a bug of some kind). However, it should be noted that **you are expected to know how to set up Riivolution patches and/or Kamek before making use of these. If you open an issue regarding setup of these two things, please do not expect any support.**

Currently, these are all of the features available:
## Finished
- [SpriteTex fixes/additions](/SpriteTex) (NewerSMBW, NSMBWer+)
## Unfinished
## Planned

## Credits
When other people are involved in something made here, their name will be listed. **If you deserve credit but were not credited (very sorry), please open a pull request and make that change.**
