# Kirblue's NSMBW Stuff
This is collection of random stuff I've made over the years for NSMBW.

If you have trouble/issues setting up one of these things, feel free to open an issue (or a pull request if you want to fix a bug of some kind). However, it should be noted that **you are expected to know how to set up Riivolution patches and/or Kamek before making use of these. If you open an issue regarding setup of these two things, please do not expect any support.**

This is what's currently released:
- [SpriteTex fixes/additions](/SpriteTex) (NewerSMBW, NSMBWer+)
- [Custom Sprites](/CustomSprites) (NewerSMBW*, NSMBWer+)
    - NewerSMBW does not come with support for [More Sprites](https://github.com/Developers-Collective/NSMBW-Custom-Sprites/releases/tag/MoreSprites) by default. If you want to use these, you'll need to install that before use.
