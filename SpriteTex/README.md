# SpriteTex Fixes
A collection of fixes for broken SpriteTex settings. These should be fully compatible between NewerSMBW and NSMBWer+, as both (for the most part) share the same SpriteTex.

## Setup
A very fun and simple three-step process.
1. Find the matching/similar assembly/YAML patch in `spritetex.S`/`spritetex.yaml` (if necessary)
2. Paste the code from here into your file.
3. Compile.
